             <p class="heading4">Rohan is one of the most helpful and down to earth person I know. He is always keen to know new things and share his experiences, he has helped me whether it be working collaboratively or giving me career advice. It's a lot of fun to be around him as he keeps everybody entertained and constantly shares his knowledge. I am always astonished by his time management as he always ends up meeting the deadlines whatever the work it might be.</p>

Rohan has largely influenced me  and encouraged me everytime I needed him. Whatever I'm doing today is just because of the correct encouragement & motivation given by Rohan at the time when I needed it the most.  He is the best person one should talk to whenever one is demotivated,  because he will make sure you are driven now.</p>
